  ## Description:
  This is an easy to use command line application to create a team profile with some basic information, including their name, position, office number, and other specific information such as github account or school, depending on their role within the team. Once all of the team members have been added, a fresh webpage is created. The email links will open in the user's default email account and the github link will take you to their account. 
  
  ## Installation:
  This project uses the Inquirer and Jest packages. To use the application Inquirer will need to be installed. This is done by typing in npm install inquirer, or if the package.json is included, npm i, will install all required depencies. 
  
  ## Usage:
  Once all of the required dependencies are installed, all you need to do is open the command line and ensure it is for the folder that contains the index.js file. In the command linetype in node index.js and follow the prompts. The completed webpage will be found in the dist folder.
